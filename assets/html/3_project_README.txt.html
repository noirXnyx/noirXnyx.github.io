<pre><span class="s0">To run this program, kindly do the following</span>
<span class="s0">Note: Enlarge this screen for better viewing</span>

<span class="s0">1.	Open PyCharm. Then, click on a new project. Name it however you want.</span>

<span class="s0">2.	Part C.1</span>
	<span class="s0">i.	Create a new Python file, ‘weather_data.py.’ </span>
	<span class="s0">ii.	Copy and paste the code from weather_data.py file. This is needed for all the steps/parts except for part C2. </span>
	<span class="s0">iii.	Leave this for now.</span>

<span class="s0">3.	Part C.3, C.4, C.5, C.6</span>
	<span class="s0">Creating main.py and database.py files</span>
		<span class="s0">i.	First, create a new Python file ‘main.py’ and copy the code in main.py file</span>
		<span class="s0">ii.	Create a new Python file, ‘database.py,’ and copy the code in the database.py file.</span>
		<span class="s0">iii.	Ensure all modules and packages are installed and imported.</span>
		<span class="s0">iv.	To check if these modules and packages are properly configured and installed, open the terminal and run this code ‘pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt. This will create a 			text file within the program. This text file contains the packages and versions necessary to run the program.</span>

	<span class="s0">Part C.2 – Click run or type python main.py in the terminal for this part</span>

	<span class="s0">Adding and connecting to SQLite database: Do this before running main.py file</span>
	<span class="s0">i.	Upon clicking the run button while on the main.py file, it will create ‘weather.db’ on the left sidebar. Right-click on the ‘weather.db’ and click copy path/references.</span>
	<span class="s0">ii.	If you do not see the database tools on the right sidebar, then follow these steps:</span>
			<span class="s0">Main Menu &gt; View &gt; Tool Windows &gt; Database</span>
	<span class="s0">iii.	In the database tools, click the plus (+) sign. Locate data source. Then, find SQLite and click it.</span>
	<span class="s0">iv.	STAY IN THE GENERAL TAB AND DO THESE</span>
			<span class="s0">Name: “Any name you want, or use the same name as the one in your main.py/database.py files”</span>
			<span class="s0">Create DDL Mapping: Do not change it – it remains uncheck</span>
			<span class="s0">Comment: not needed. Leave it empty</span>
			<span class="s0">File: Paste the path of your weather.db here</span>
			<span class="s0">URL: no need to change. Automatically generated.</span>

			<span class="s0">Click the test connection and wait for the confirmation. Click apply and OK.</span>

<span class="s0">•Run the main.py by clicking the run button or through the terminal: python main.py</span>
<span class="s0">•In the main.py Python console, you can see the processed data, and the last line that starts with ID is the data loaded and saved into your weather_data table (located in the database).</span>

<span class="s0">4.	Part D</span>
	<span class="s0">i.	Create a new Python file, ‘test.py’.</span>
	<span class="s0">ii.	Copy and paste the code from the test.py file and run it.</span>
	<span class="s0">iii.	In the test.py Python console, you will see the results in red.</span>
	<span class="s0">iv.	There is no need to delete anything after the test as the data will be removed afterward.</span>
